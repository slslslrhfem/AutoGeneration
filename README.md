# Autocomposition
 Implementation of FLAGNet

Please Use
tensorflow==1.15.0
Keras==2.3.1
Keras_Applications==1.0.8

Code is now refactoring. For now, use ipynb code in colab and use commented code that load dataset with direct file access.

(For now, I saved data as array with pickle and load it for speed and handling colab's file access issue.)
